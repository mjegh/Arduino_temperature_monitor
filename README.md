Arduino_temperature_monitor

A project to monitor the temperature in our machine room and use nagios
to tell us when it gets too hot.

Code originally from a post on my blog "monitoring our machine room temperature with nagios, perl and arduino" at http://martin-evans.me.uk/node/140.

You will need an Arduino, a TMP36, a soldering iron, and nagios (although not strictly necessary).
